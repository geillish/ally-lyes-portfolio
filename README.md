# Ally Lyes Portfolio Website

A website I wanted to create to showcase my skills, how I code and what I find important - as a kind of sandbox to continue learning and expanding.


## Technologies Used

- I am sending my code to GitHub for others to use, although I am usually more familiar with using more private repos on Bitbucket with a team.
- Django (Python) is used to create and maintain the backend of the site, something I am very familiar with - having 3 years experience with Python and over 1 year experience with the framework Django.
- React is something I want to learn to become more fullstack in my approach, already knowing SASS to create clean CSS and with a knowledge in JavaScript (along with JQuery), using React seemed to be the logical next step in my development and this site should be a reflection of that.


## About Me

I am a web developer from Ireland with a BTEC in Digital Media and a HDip in Computer Science. After leaving UCC (University College Cork), I went into a Web Design internship where my Adobe skills were put to good use and I learned a lot about Front End Development using Javascript (with JQuery).

Later I was brought onto a small team as a Junior Developer mainly focusing on the Backend using Django. My skills have substancially expanded in this position as I helped build new features as part of a team and sometimes by myself. As I grew, I took on more duties which focused on Full Stack Development by creating landing pages for our site using the designs which were given to me and bringing them to life for the web. 

I also expanded my Data Science knowledge as I was given the opportunity to take the lead on the reporting project for the company - quickly expanding my MySQL skills to extract data from our database, clean it and then visualise it using PowerBI. 

## Info About Repo

For security I am going to be keeping all database files off of this repository and I also use an extra settings.py file (which is included in my GitIgnore) in my main Django app for the site which contains all the information for my local database and IP details for mobile testing.
